""" Welcome to the Lindenmayer System Program we created for our exam project!
    We chose this project because it looked interesting and seemed like a good
    way to combine some things we had learned in Math 1 this semester as well
    as what we learned in programming.
    
    Lindenmayer systems were created to model natural systems using simple and 
    iterable rules. This program will display a couple of these systems: Koch and
    Sierpinski.
    
    What this program does is it first asks you to select a Lindenmayer system.
    Then it will ask for a number of iterations. 
    NOTE! The number of iterations is limited to prevent excessive 
    computational runtime.
    Then the program will give you the option to plot the system. This will 
    display a plot with the selected Lindenmayer System
    
    Enjoy!

"""
This function takes the inputs of System(Koch or Sierpinski) and N(iterations)
and creates a string based on a series of rules which correspond to each system.
These rules are stored in a dicitonary.

 This function will display the interactive menu, from which all the previous functions can be accessed. It does not take any
 inputs, as it is runs once the whole program is run. It presents several choices, which execute different parts of the whole script
 depending on conditions imposed by if-statements.
